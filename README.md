# Hex | 0x48 0x65 0x78
👋🏻 I'm working toward a career in Linux. 🐧  

Lately, I've been learning Ruby and soon diving back into Perl. I passed my RHCSA in October 2021 and I'm looking to take the RHCE exam in 2022. I like Python but for some reason Bash is my new favorite programming language. If I get any free-time between those projects, I like to work through Capture the flag (CTF) challenges for fun.
